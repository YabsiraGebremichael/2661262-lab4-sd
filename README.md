This project is a simple Country Information Lookup Tool.
It lets users type in a country name, then fetches data from the REST Countries API 
to display details such as the countryâ€™s name, capital, population, region, and flag. If the country has neighbors, their names and flags are also shown.

The interface is styled with basic CSS for readability, and interaction is handled with JavaScript through a button click event.
